## **Data Migration Using Python**

This Python script defines a class DatabaseMigration that facilitates the migration of data between two PostgreSQL databases. The main tasks include:

**Extracting Data:** It fetches data from the source database in manageable chunks to avoid memory overload.

**Transforming Data:** The data undergoes basic transformations, such as removing extra spaces and handling missing values.

**Loading Data:** The transformed data is then loaded into a target database.

**Logging:** The script logs key actions and errors during the process for traceability.

**Environment Configuration:** It uses environment variables for database connection details and other configurations (like chunk size).

**Error Handling:** Errors are caught and logged at each stage, ensuring that any issues during extraction, transformation, or loading are recorded.

The migration process is designed to handle large datasets efficiently by processing them in chunks. After the migration, the database connections are closed.
